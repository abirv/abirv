I'm experienced Python Developer with background in Cyber Security and Pentesting with 10+ years in IT .
AsyncIO | FastAPI Flask | React PureJS Bootstrap | MongoDB

For the past 4 years, I have been working in a revolutionary Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) for Industrial Control Systems as a lead Developer and Architect. I wrote it in Python as lightweight and high performance distributed system with unlimited events per second, which now connected to 500+ ICS networks. 

I also worked 5 years as an Cyber Security Specialist and Pentester. I have performed Audits and Penetration Testing of various Industrial and Banking Systems. I really like Kali Linux and OSCP 'Try Harder!'
